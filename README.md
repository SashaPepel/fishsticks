# fishsticks 
Fishsticks or fish fingers are a type of food probably invented in the United Kingdom. They are made of a whitefish and pinkfish like cod, hake, haddock, salmon, or pollock, that is battered and breaded. They are often eaten with tartar sauce, or ketchup. *Mmm Fishy*. :flushed::+1:

>Fishsticks first came about as a result of the invention of the plate froster in 1929, the first quick freezer. For rapid freezing, food needed to be in slim rectangular slabs. A suitable candidate for this freezing method was fishsticks, slivers (small, thin pieces) cut from large fish and dipped in bread crumbs for frying.
